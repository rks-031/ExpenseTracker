# ExpenseTracker
This is small yet interesting example of an Expense Tracker that keeps a check on the item purchased, it's amount, it's year and month of manufacturing. 
Along with this, it also allows the user to add new expenses in the existing list and gives a very beautiful graphical represention of expenses in form of charts.

There can be many additional features that can be implemented in this tracker. 
You're are very much welcomed to come up with your own ideas!!
